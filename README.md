# Java_Paint
A pretty simple Paint application in Java, leveraging Design Patterns.

For all intents of the project, that being a school project, this project is complete.  

Using this program, you are able to create three types of shape (Ellipses, Rectangles, and Triangles) with varying shading types (filled in, outline only, or both) and with different color combinations.  Additional functionality includes, the ability to copy/paste, undo/redo changes, move and delete shapes.
